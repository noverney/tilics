Let’s say you want to watch a movie. Downloading it would be a matter of minutes. When ordering it online, the shipment might take a week to arrive. Imagine now you want to watch twenty movies. Downloading them might take a few hours now. But the shipment would still arrive in one week. Now what about a hundred movies? Or a thousand?

When analysing the complexity of an algorithm, it is important to think about the *scalability* of a program. It tells you how the runtime of a program depends on the number of elements given as input. In the example above, the time needed to download the movies depends on the amount. Computer scientists would say: The runtime scales with n, where n stands for the number of movies. When having them shipped, the time doesn’t depend on this number, which means it doesn't scale.
