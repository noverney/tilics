# Why buying hard copies is sometimes better than downloading.

Let’s say you want to watch a movie. Downloading it would be a matter of minutes. When ordering it online, the shipment might take a week to arrive. Imagine now you want to watch twenty movies. Downloading them might take a few hours now. But shipping them still only takes a week. Now what about a hundred movies? Or a thousand?

When describing the complexity of an algorithm, computer scientists use the so called Big O notation. It tells you how the runtime of a program depends on the number of elements given as input. In the example above, the time needed to download linearly depends on the amount of movies. This would be described by O(n), where n stands for the number of movies. When having them shipped, the time doesn’t depend on this number. This would be written as O(1).
