# Why Uptime Matters
<!-- END TITLE -->

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
The time since a computer was started is referred to as its
**uptime**.  When the computer is rebooted (or crashes), its uptime is
reset to zero.  The time the computer is not running is called
**downtime**.

When running a service, such as a website, we want it to be available
at all times.  This means that the server the website is running on
has to be available all the time.  However, computers also need to be
updated from time to time, which usually involves a reboot, or they
may simply crash.  Thus, a high uptime is a sign for a highly
available service.

To work around this conflict between availability and the need to
update, we can distribute a service over multiple servers, thereby
providing redundancy.  This allows us to take a single server offline,
while keeping the services running, focussing on **service uptime**
rather than **server uptime**.
