For some problems in Computer Science, it can be proven that there are
no "efficient" ways of solving them. In this case, the only resort is
**brute force**. Brute force means that you let the computer try
___ out ___ every ___ possible ___ value ___ that ___ potentially
___ solves ___ the ___ problem ___ until you succeed.

Several cryptographic algorithms are based on such problems where the
secret key can only be guessed -- or found by exhaustively trying
out all possible values during a few billion years.
