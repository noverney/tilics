<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
For some problems in Computer Science, it can be proven that there are
no "efficient" ways of solving them. In this case, the only resort is
**brute force**. Brute force means that you let the computer try
... out ... every ... possible ... value ... that ... potentially
... solves ... the ... problem ... until you succeed.

Several cryptographic algorithms are based on such problems where the
secret key can only be guessed ... or found by exhaustively trying
out all possible values during a few billion years.
