<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
The null value has a special meaning in computer science, it is used to declare that a value is not yet defined or known. 
The speciality of null is, that altough it shows us that a value is missing, it is itself a value. So it is possible to compare two 
non existing values. Suppose we have data about a patient, 
it does make a different if the patient has no disease (0) or is not yet diagnosed (null).
